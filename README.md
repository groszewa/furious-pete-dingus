Project: Prime Shuffle

IDEAS:
-Can use noUISlider.js for price range selection (need to figure out how to use with rich uncle)
-Is one dropdown menu enough? can maybe switch to hierarchical approach (i.e. root->family->brother->older) .... Maybe this is too complicated?  Maybe even an interface that works like the windows Start button?
-Should we also add a selection mechanism to filter interests?  What if you know your sister likes vinyl, you could potentially add a second path (i.e. who are you shopping for/what are you shopping for?)
REVISIONS:
-changed test_page.html to index.html (this is standard for reasons I don't remember)
-added support directory (there is a .css file for a price slider in there now)
-added dropdown menu for family members
